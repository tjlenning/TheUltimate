    <h1>My Bio</h1>
    <p class="justify">Growing up in Southern California, I love the sun! I have a passion for renewable energy and believe that our sustainable future lies in renewable energies such as wind, water, and solar power. Through increasingly beneficial technologies, I believe we can make an individual difference in preventing climate change while saving a lot of money in the process by giving up fossil fuels. I study Environmental Science and Sustainability at Brigham Young University and am focused on making a global difference one household at a time. If I am not working, I love spending time with my family at the beach.</p>
